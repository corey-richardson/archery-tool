We only collect the data necessary for club management and safety. We do not use your data for unrelated purposes.

## Lawful Basis

We process your data based on:
- Contract (for membership management)

- Consent (for emergency contacts and communications)

## Data Sharing

Your data is shared only with authorised club administrators for any clubs you join, and only for the purposes described above. Your data is never sold or shared with third parties for marketing purposes.

## Data Storage

Your data is stored securely on cloud provider's servers. As of now, data may be stored in the United States. We use reputable providers through Vercel to ensure your data is protected in accordance with UK law.

## OAuth Providers

The platform uses secure Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication through OAuth2 to protect your data. OAuth providers do not give direct access to the user's external account. The application stores a short-lived or refreshable **token** issued during authentication. **The database does not track the external account's profile, only the identifiers and tokens necessary for login sessions are stored.**

## Your Rights

You have the right to:
- Access your data
- Correct or update your data
- Request deletion of your data
- Object to or restrict processing

To exercise your rights, contact [@corey.richardson.archery](https://www.instagram.com/corey.richardson.archery/). Other ways to contact me can be found on my [Linktree page](https://linktr.ee/coreyrichardson).

## Data Retention

We retain your data only as long as necessary for club administration or as required by law. Club administrators access to your information is revoked when you leave a club.

## Juniors

If you are under 16, we require parental or guardian consent to process your data. This consent should be acquired by your club administrators and they are responsible for ensuring the appropriate and verifiable authorisations are in place.

## Security

We use authentication and role-based access controls to protect your data. Only authorised club officials with the relevant roles can access your information. 

## Recommendations

We recommend that you only join clubs you trust to manage your personal information appropriately. Before joining, please verify that the club is the genuine organisation you intend to join, and not a similarly named or impersonating club. If you encounter any suspicious or potentially fraudulent clubs, please report them to the platform administrator immediately.

## Policy Updates

We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page.
